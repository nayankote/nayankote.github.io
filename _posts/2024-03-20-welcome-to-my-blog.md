# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post on my new website. I'll be using this space to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

## What to Expect

- Technical deep dives
- Project updates
- Book reviews
- Personal reflections

## Micro Updates

You'll notice a sidebar on the right with micro-updates. These are quick thoughts and progress updates that I'll be posting regularly. They're tagged with categories like `@main` for general updates or specific project tags like `@arduino` for project-specific updates.

## Stay Connected

Feel free to follow along as I share my journey through both long-form blog posts and micro-updates.
