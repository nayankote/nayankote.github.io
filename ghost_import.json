I'll be using this space to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.\n\n## What to Expect\n\n- Technical deep dives\n- Project updates\n- Book reviews\n- Personal reflections\n\n## Micro Updates\n\nYou'll notice a sidebar on the right with micro-updates. These are quick thoughts and progress updates that I'll be posting regularly. They're tagged with categories like `@main` for general updates or specific project tags like `@arduino` for project-specific updates.\n\n## Stay Connected\n\nFeel free to follow along as I share my journey through both long-form blog posts and micro-updates.",
